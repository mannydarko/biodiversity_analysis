# Belly Button Biodiversity


This assignment was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). Using Plotly.js we created a Bubble Chart to display each sample, and a Pie Chart showing the top 10.

Flask API was used to serve the data needed.

## Note

* Don't forget to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before you start your server.

* Use `console.log` inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.

* Refer to the [Plotly.js Documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/) when building the plots.
